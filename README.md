# AutoReef.APIGateway

Intended to be used with the software developed under the AutoReef project, but currently adding support for other smart devices, including AquaIllumination lights.

The aim is to add support for aquarium control, through Google Home. Adding the functionality required for that, will also open up the possibility for much more.
